# Coroutine Timer - an example timer implementation with coroutines 

This repository contains the code discussed in [this article](https://gmetal.dev/posts/unit-testing-withtimeout-with-kotest/).
It contains an example timer implementation, that can be used for executing periodic actions. The
repository also details how to unit test the code, and how the unit testing was evolved with various
techniques and two different testing frameworks ([JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) and [Kotest](https://kotest.io/)).
